- title: "Age Requirement"
  body: "<p>Due to the nature of our ministry, we feel that 17 is the minimum age at which a young man should take part in CMO. However, the Lord has led differently in the past. If you are under 17 years old, and you feel that you would be a good candidate for CMO, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:info@euroteamoutreach.org\">contact us</a>. Such requests are decided on a case by case basis.</p>"

- title: "Clear Salvation Testimony"
  body: "<p>If you are going to tell others how to be saved, you need to be confident of your own salvation first. When you apply for CMO, we ask that you send us a printed copy of your personal testimony - that is, how you came to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior.</p>"

- title: "Financial Support"
  body: "<p>While we recognize the validity of complete trust in the Lord for financial support, we need to have at least a general idea of how you plan to pay for your expenses during your stay in Ukraine. Each team member (including our full time staff) must be responsible for their own finances.</p><p>While participating in CMO, you will need to cover such expenses as rent, food, transportation, and whatever medical needs may arise. At this time, we estimate that you will need a <strong>minimum of $%{weekly_cost} per week</strong>. For more details on finances, please refer to the <a href=\"/downloads\">Info Pack</a>, page %{info_pack_finance_page}.</p>"

- title: "Men Only"
  body: "<p>Women certainly play a vital role in evangelism world-wide. However, this particular project is not well-suited to a co-ed environment. One of the primary objectives of CMO is to provide missions training for men, and we believe that this is best accomplished without the distractions and complexities of a mixed-gender group.</p>"

- title: "One-month Minimum"
  body: "<p>We ask that all young men participating in CMO commit to at least one month in Ukraine. It is not practical to come for less. If possible, we strongly recommend that you plan to stay for the full seven-week duration of the project in order to receive maximum benefit from your training.</p><p>CMO %{current_project_year} will begin on %{project_start_date}. All team members are asked to arrive no later than %{max_arrival_date}. If you think you will have difficulty arranging your travel plans to concide with this window, please <a href=\"mailto:info@euroteamoutreach.org\">contact us</a> to discuss other options. More detailed travel information is available in the <a href=\"/downloads\">Info Pack</a>.</p><p>If you are a married man or a pastor (church leader), and feel that one month is more than you would be able to stay, please <a href=\"mailto:info@euroteamoutreach.org\">contact us</a> about this. We recognize that for some, a shorter stay would be more beneficial.</p>"

- title: "Statement of Faith"
  body: "<p>Before you apply for CMO %{current_project_year}, we ask that you review our Statement of Faith. This document outlines the basic doctrines which we hold as fundamental to the Christian faith. While we do not ask anyone to strictly conform to every detail, we do need to know that you are generally on the same page. You may <a href=\"http://www.euroteamoutreach.org/index.php?p=believe\" target=\"_blank\">read our Statement of Faith online</a> or find it on page 7 of the <a href=\"/downloads\">Application</a>.</p>"
