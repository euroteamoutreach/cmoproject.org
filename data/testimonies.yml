  text: "<p>&rdquo;During CMO...I felt I was a key member of the team. In a day&rsquo;s time, I could do as much as they. The work is so structured, that an American guy, with practically no knowledge of Ukrainian, can keep pace with the full-time missionary in the day&rsquo;s work. No more tagging along watching. Get in there and do it yourself. You can be a missionary for the summer!&rdquo;"

You will learn techniques for more effective evangelism at home and abroad, work alongside of awesome guys, and most importantly, make a difference for the kingdom. I couldn&rsquo;t recommend CMO too highly!&rdquo;"

I cannot think of a better way to spend a summer (or life for that matter) than serving and telling others about Christ. I pray that many more young men take advantage of this opportunity and in order to catch/fuel a burning passion for reaching others with the Gospel.&rdquo;"

  text: "<p>&rdquo;How can you summarize CMO 2006? In one word: life-changing. ... I would highly recommend CMO to all young men who are wanting to be men of God. Not just those who are interested in foreign missions, but even those who are going to stay in the States for the rest of their lives. CMO 2006 changed my perspective. I now understand the world-wide need for the Gospel. I have met people I would have never met before, who challenged me in my beliefs. They forced me to reevaluate; to decide what I believe and why I believe it; to research the Bible to prove it, not rely on faulty human reasoning. CMO 2006 was an amazing experience for me and I pray that the lessons I have learned will never fall away.&rdquo;"
