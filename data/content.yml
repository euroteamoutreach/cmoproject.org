call_to_men:
  <p>The Carpathian Mountains are home to thousands of unreached Ukrainians, living quite isolated from the modern world. Most major cities in Ukraine have at least some Gospel witness, but for many living in the mountains, Christ is little more than a figurine dangling from a chain. Religious though they are, most have never heard the call to believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
  <p>Young man, do you know Jesus? Have you been washed from your sins and made a son of God? Then God has called YOU to take the Gospel into all the world. Every summer, we take a team of men into the mountains of Ukraine and preach Jesus to those who have never heard. Your efforts are needed on that team. There are people in Ukraine that will not be saved unless you go and point them to Christ. Will you join us? Read on and find out how!</p>
