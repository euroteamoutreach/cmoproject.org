- title: "What are the start/end dates for CMO 2016?"
  answer: "<p>CMO 2016 will begin on June 20, 2016 and end on August 5, 2016.</p>"

- title: "How much does it cost to participate in CMO?"
  answer: "<p>At present, the cost is about $280 per week minimum. This amount can be broken down into two basic parts: 1) Personal Support (~$140 per week) and 2) Operations Fee ($140 per week).</p><p>Your personal support is for such things as food, transportation costs and other items you will want/need to purchase while in Ukraine. We recommend a minimum personal support level of $140 per week, but ultimately this is up to you. The Operations Fee (also $140 per week) is mandatory for all CMO team members. The fee will cover your rent, utilities, literature, and other ministry related expenses which you will incur during the project. Your Operations Fee is due in full on the day you arrive in Ukraine. For more details on finances, please refer to the CMO 2015 Info Pack, page 15.</p>"

  answer: "<p>answer text here...</p>"

- title: "What is the minimum time commitment required to participate in CMO?"
  answer: "<p>We ask all team members who join us for CMO to commit to at least one month. We feel that by staying at least one month, team members will receive maximum benefit and development from the project. However, if you would like to participate in CMO and are not able to stay that long, we would still like to talk to you. Please contact us to discuss the details of your particular situation. Such cases are ultimately decided by our board on a case by case basis.</p>"

- title: "During CMO, what kinds of expenses will I have to cover?"
  answer: "<p>You will be responsible for any and all expenses that you incur. These include, but are not limited to: apartment rent, ministry expenses, transportation costs (taxi's, trams, bus and train fares, etc.), groceries, camping gear.</p>"

- title: "I would like to come for CMO, but I'm not sure if I'll have the minimum amount that you specify for monthly support. Can I still come?"
  answer: "<p>If you are not sure that you will have all the necessary funds for your support while in Ukraine, or if you have less than our recommended minimum, you are still welcome to come. We believe strongly that God is able to provide supernaturally for the needs of those who serve Him. However, make sure it is indeed God who is calling you. If you run short of money while you are here you may have to go home. Don't build a tower without counting the cost. (Luke 14:26)</p>"

- title: "I'd like to participate in CMO, but I don't know Ukrainian. How can I possibly tell people about Jesus?"
  answer: "<p>Remember: a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country. Jesus made this observation Himself. If you come to Ukraine from overseas, you will have the ear of Ukrainians in a way that a local minister might not. Several of our staff speak fluent Ukrainian, and we will translate for you when necessary. There is also much that can be done without having to speak at all (e.g. tract distribution, chalk art, multimedia setup, literature printing and collation, etc.)</p>"

- title: "I want to come for CMO, but I am under 17. Can I still come?"
  answer: "<p>Our minimum age requirement for all ETO outreaches is 17. There are many reasons for this, the main ones being maturity and liability concerns. However, we know that God can call someone younger than that. If you are under 17, and you feel strongly that God is calling you to serve with ETO, please contact us. Such requests are evaluated by our board on a case by case basis.</p>"

- title: "I want to come for CMO, but I am not a US/Canadian citizen. Can I still come?"
  answer: "<p>Euro Team Outreach deals primarily with US/Canadian citizens. We are a US-based organization, and all of our materials, application forms, legal documents, etc. are geared for Americans/Canadians.</p><p>At present, the immigration requirements imposed on American or Canadian citizens are fairly lenient. If you are a non-US/Canadian citizen, and you feel that God is calling you to serve with ETO, please contact us. Such requests are evaluated by our board on a case by case basis.</p>"

- title: "I am a pastor/church leader. May I come for less time than the standard one-month minimum?"
  answer: "<p>Yes, you may. We recognize that pastors/church leaders have obligations which often do not allow for extended absences. If you are interested in visiting CMO during the summer, please contact usto discuss further details.</p>"

- title: "I am married and/or have children. May I come for less time than the standard one-month minimum?"
  answer: "<p>Yes, you may. Please contact us to discuss further details.</p>"

- title: "I am a young lady, and I want to get involved in overseas missions. Does ETO have any projects for young ladies?"
  answer: "<p>At this time all of our outreaches are setup to accommodate young men only. Many of our activities present situations (such as multi-day camping in the mountains) where a co-ed group would not be feasible.</p>"
