About CMO Going Forward
=======================

Over the past few months, God has blessed our ministry with tremendous growth. New students are enrolling in [Bible First][getbiblefirst] almost daily here in Ukraine, and in the US, an increasing number of people are [starting their own ministries][training] using the Bible First program. In addition, we now have both Spanish and French language translations in progress.

Much of this growth is the result of many years of outreach by the men who have participated in Carpathian Mountain Outreach. Since our first CMO project in the summer of 2006, over 40 men have ministered with a CMO team, and together they have distributed nearly 2 million pieces of Bible literature across Ukraine. The impact of their work has been keenly felt, and we are now reaping an exciting harvest.

But harvests need laborers, and as always, laborers are in short supply. In order to be good stewards of the ministry opportunities God has presented this year, we have decided to postpone CMO until 2018. This decision was made in order to allow us to focus our attentions on several developing ministry fronts.

CMO is an exciting ministry that has born much fruit. If God allows, we look forward to resuming it in the summer of 2018. Thank you for your prayers and support for our team as we strive to communicate Christ to the world.
